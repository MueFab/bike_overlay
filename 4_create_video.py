Video Creation from Image Frames

This script creates a video from a sequence of image frames stored in a specified directory.
The resulting video is saved in the specified output file path. It also cleans up by deleting
the frame images after the video is created.

Usage:
    python create_video.py <frame_dir> <output_file>

Dependencies:
    - OpenCV (cv2)
